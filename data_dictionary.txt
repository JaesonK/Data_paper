NOTES:
- * indicates a set of binary columns (one per modality).
- Certain sections of the questionnaire are conditionally structured. For example, if a respondent indicates they do not use Mobile Money (MoMo), then all subsequent detailed questions about specific MoMo uses (e.g., sending, receiving, payments) are automatically recorded as ‘No’. This conditional logic helps reduce respondent burden and ensures data consistency.
- Derived indicators (e.g., number of languages spoken) are computed.
