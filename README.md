0. Abstract
A representative sample of 1,500 producers was interviewed through a questionnaire using the tablet-assisted one-on-one interview method to assess the adoption of digital technologies among market gardening producers in Benin. The questionnaire was designed to measure the digital divides within these rural populations. Based on a classic digital divide framework, the questionnaire aims to provide information on socio-economic characteristics and digital uptake by populations typically characterized by low connectivity and low skills. The collected data can be accessed in tabular form from an open repository, allowing the current state to be analyzed and informing the design of future digital rural development projects.

        Description of data collection & The survey was completed by 1,500 market gardeners from Benin. The sample is methodically selected and representative of these populations. Market gardeners were randomly selected using the most comprehensive and up-to-date database available in the country. Data collection took place in 2022 and 2023 through in-person interviews. \\ \\

Value of the Data
-	The database collects data in regions where the availability of digital data is not very accessible.
-	It surveys those most vulnerable to the digital divide.
-	It facilitates comparisons between three key value chains in West Africa.
-	The database can inform future agricultural or rural development projects and guide the design of public policies.
-	It is accessible to researchers, public administrators, funders, experts and development project managers.

1.	Objective
Improved infrastructure and the proliferation of mobile phones in West Africa are driving changes and challenges. There is growing interest in digital technologies and drives substantial public funding, which fosters the promise of development. However, as digital technologies become more widespread, digital divides are emerging, especially in rural areas. The objective of this survey, based on a digital divide framework, is to collect data on market gardeners in Benin. The resulting database will provide valuable information to local and international researchers and officials, and guide the allocation of funds from public and international agencies, allowing for better targeting of the most excluded groups taking into account their access, capacity and use of digital technologies.

2.	Data Collection and Description
The questionnaire was designed to assess socio-economic characteristics and the adoption of digital technologies. Data collection took place during the first semester of 2023. These are original data collected as part of the "Digital Divide" project (https://www.fracture-numerique.org/). Data collection followed the stages of digital adoption: motivation for adopting or not adopting digital technology, access to networks, devices, and mobile plans, capacities, and usage patterns, with a particular focus on professional-related activities (Table 1). Following a pre-survey, a closed questionnaire was formalized and digitized, and it was administered and centralized using the KoboToolBox software.
To enhance the quality and reliability of the primary survey data, data handling and restructuring were performed to create a cohesive database containing descriptions of the variables from the four main sections of the questionnaire. This survey therefore includes both structural data related to farmers and data on digital adoption.
