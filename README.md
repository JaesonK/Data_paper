# Data_paper

A representative sample of 1,500 producers was interviewed through a questionnaire using the tablet-assisted one-on-one interview method to assess the adoption of digital technologies among market gardening producers in Benin. The questionnaire was designed to measure the digital divides within these rural populations. Based on a classic digital divide framework, the questionnaire aims to provide information on socio-economic characteristics and digital uptake by populations typically characterized by low connectivity and low skills. The collected data can be accessed in tabular form from an open repository, allowing the current state to be analyzed and informing the design of future digital rural development projects.
